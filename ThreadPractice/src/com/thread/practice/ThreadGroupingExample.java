/*
  		ðŸ§  What is a Thread Group?
			A ThreadGroup in Java is used to group multiple threads together.
			This allows you to manage multiple threads as a single unit â€” like
			interrupting or checking the status of all threads in a group.
			
			âœ… Why Use Thread Groups?
				-- To manage a collection of threads together.
				-- To set a common priority or interrupt them together.
				-- To organize threads logically.
