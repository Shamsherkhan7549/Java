// 2. User-defined Packages
//You can create your own custom packages to organize your classes and interfaces. This is particularly useful for large applications to maintain clean code and prevent naming conflicts.

//How to create a user-defined package:

//Create a Package: Use the package keyword at the top of your Java file to define a package.
//Import the Package: You can import custom packages into other classes using the import keyword.

//creating and using a user-defined package:
//Step 1: Create a package and class inside it.
//Let's say you want to create a package named com.example.utilities. You would create the file MyUtility.java inside that package folder structure.

//Step 2: Create a class that uses the package.
//Now, you can use the MyUtility class in another Java file by importing it.

// Access Modifiers and Packages
//Java provides different levels of access control for classes, methods, and fields:

//public: Accessible from any other class or package.
//protected: Accessible within the same package or by subclasses.
//default (no modifier): Accessible only within the same package.
//private: Accessible only within the same class.

//Benefits of Using Packages:
//Organization: Packages help organize code into logical groupings, improving the maintainability of large applications.
//Namespace Management: Packages prevent name conflicts by ensuring that classes with the same name can exist in different packages.
//Access Control: Packages allow access control mechanisms, determining which classes, methods, and fields are accessible to other classes or packages.
//Modularity: By grouping related classes, packages enhance the modularity and reusability of code.

// Summary
// Packages in Java are used to organize classes and interfaces into namespaces.
// Built-in packages are provided by Java (e.g., java.util, java.io), while user-defined packages are created by developers to organize their own classes.
// Packages help prevent naming conflicts, provide better code organization, and enforce access control within applications.
